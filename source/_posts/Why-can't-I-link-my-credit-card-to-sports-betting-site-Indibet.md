#  Why can't I link my credit card to sports betting site Indibet?

There could be a few reasons why you can't link your credit card to sports betting site Indibet. The first reason could be that the site doesn't allow credit card deposits. The second reason is that your bank has blocked or declined the transaction.

If the site doesn't allow credit card deposits, you'll need to find an alternate payment method. Some of the most popular payment methods for online gambling include debit cards, e-wallets, and prepaid cards. If your bank has blocked or declined the transaction, you'll need to contact your bank to find out why.

It's important to note that some banks will block gambling transactions because of their country's regulations on online gambling. If this is the case, there may not be anything that you can do to circumvent the block.

#  How to link your credit card to sports betting site Indibet

Sports betting is quickly gaining in popularity all over the world. In India, where cricket is the national sport, interest in betting on cricket matches has grown rapidly in recent years. Online sports betting sites such as Indibet make it easy to place bets on cricket and other sports.

Most online sports betting sites require you to provide them with your credit card details in order to deposit money into your account. If you want to withdraw any winnings, you will also need to provide your credit card details to the site. This can be a bit of a hassle, especially if you only want to bet occasionally.

If you don't want to give your credit card details to an online sports betting site, there is another option: linking your credit card to the site. This allows you to deposit and withdraw money without having to provide your credit card details each time. Here's how it works:

1. Sign up for an account with a sports betting site such as Indibet.

2. Provide your credit card details when prompted (you will only need to do this once).

3. Select the "credit" or "debit" option when making a deposit into your account.

4. A unique four-digit code will be generated and sent to your registered email address. This code needs to be entered when making a deposit or withdrawal from your account.

5. To make a deposit, enter the amount you want to deposit and then enter the four-digit code into the "credit card" field on the payment page. To make a withdrawal, enter the four-digit code into the "withdrawal" field on the payment page and then select your preferred withdrawal method (e.g., bank transfer or courier).

That's all there is to it! By linking your credit card to your online sports betting account, you can easily make deposits and withdrawals without having to provide your credit card details each time.
