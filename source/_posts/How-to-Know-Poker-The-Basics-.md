#  How to Know Poker: The Basics 

Pennies on the table, chips stacked in neat mounds and Dealer button ready to rotate around the table - the classic sights of a casino poker game. But even if you've never played poker before, don't worry; this guide has everything you need to know to join in on the fun.

To start, each player is dealt two cards face down, these are known as hole cards. The aim of the game is to make the best five card hand from these and the community cards that are placed face up in the middle of the table - these are shared by all players. There are many different variations of poker, but most follow this basic format.

The player with the strongest hand at the end of the game wins. This can be decided in one of two ways: either the player with the best hand (according to traditional poker rankings) or by taking into account who has put money into the pot - also known as a 'showdown'. In a showdown, if more than one player has a winning hand, then the player with the highest ranking hand takes home the pot.

If you're just starting out, it's important to learn which hands are stronger than others. The rank of hands starts with Royal Flush (A-K-Q-J-10 all same suit), followed by Straight Flush (five consecutive cards all of same suit), Four of a Kind (four matching cards), Full House (three matching cards plus two of another matching card), Flush (five cards all of same suit), Straight (five consecutive cards not all of same suit), Three of a Kind (three matching cards), Two Pair (two different pairs), and finally, One Pair (two matching cards).

In Texas Hold'em and many other variants, Ace can be high or low so that A-2-3-4-5 is both a low straight and a high straight. The Ace can also be used as a wild card, meaning it can be substituted for any other card in order to make up a better hand.

Now that you know how to play, it's time to put your new skills into practice! Head to your nearest casino and sign up for a game - remember to always gamble responsibly.

#  How to Know Poker: Playing the Game 
In the game of poker, there are countless terms and phrases that players must be familiar with in order to play correctly. This can make the learning process seem daunting to beginners, but with a little guidance and practice, anyone can learn how to play poker like a pro.

The first step is understanding the basics of the game. Poker is a five-card draw game where each player is dealt two concealed cards (hole cards), and then has the opportunity to draw up to three more cards to make their best five-card hand. The aim of the game is to amass the best possible hand using any combination of these five cards, and players bet on their hands by placing chips in a pot that progresses around the table clockwise. At showdown, the player with the best hand takes the pot.

There are various types of poker games, but Texas Hold'em and Omaha are among the most popular. In Texas Hold'em, each player is dealt two hole cards face down, and then five community cards are placed face up on the table. Players use these seven cards (two hole cards plus five community cards) to make their best five-card hand. In Omaha, each player is dealt four hole cards instead of two, and must use exactly two of them in conjunction with three community cards to make their best hand.

Once you understand the basic rules of poker, it's time to learn some of the more common terminology used in the game: 

Blinds - The blinds are forced bets placed by the two players sitting directly to the left of the dealer button (the small blind and big blind). The small blind is typically half of what the big blind is, and both are considered live bets that must be called or raised if someone wishes to stay in the hand. 

Button - The button is a white disc that rotates around the table clockwise after every hand and indicates which player at the table is acting as dealer. 

Pot - The pot refers to all of the money that has been wagered during a given hand (including both Showdown chips and all live bets). 

Community Cards - Community cards are placed face up on the table for all players to see and use in making their best hands. 

Flop - The flop refers to when three community cards are turned over simultaneously bythe dealer. 

Turn - The turn card is revealed after fourth street goes off; it's another communal card used in conjunction with your holecards . 
River - After fifth street we have our final community card; this one's called River .
