#  Pigs Fly at Milano Casino- Who Knew?

The saying pigs fly is one that is usually used when something that is highly impossible, or highly unexpected happens. In the case of Milano Casino, this could not be more accurate. Not many people know this, but pigs do in fact fly at this casino!

The story behind how this happened is quite interesting. Back in the day, there was a really popular poker player who frequented Milano Casino. He was known as a bit of a gambler and would often take risks with his bets. One day, he was playing poker and got extremely lucky- he ended up winning a large sum of money. As he was celebrating his win, he decided to make a bet with the casino staff that he could get a pig to fly across the room. The staff took him up on his bet and gave him permission to try.

The poker player went out into the street and found the first pig he could find. He then brought it back into the casino and placed it on the poker table. To everyone's amazement, the pig flew across the room and landed right next to the pot! As you can imagine, the poker player won his bet and walked away with a lot of extra cash.

This story has been folklore at Milano Casino for many years and is still talked about today. If you're ever at Milano Casino, be sure to ask about it- you might even get to see a photo of the flying pig!

#  Don't Let the Pigs Fly Away With Your Money- Play Smart!

Pigs may be known for their intelligence, but when it comes to money, they can be pretty stupid. In fact, one study found that 88 percent of people said they’d been taken advantage of by a pig at some point in their lives. So how do you protect yourself from the economic antics of these porcine miscreants? Here are five tips:

1) Educate yourself on personal finance.

The first step is to get educated about money and personal finance. There are plenty of great books and websites out there on the subject, and it’s never too late to learn. Knowledge is power, so arm yourself with information and you’ll be in a better position to protect yourself from financial folly.

2) Stay disciplined with your spending.

It’s easy to overspend when you’re not keeping track of your expenses, but it’s a surefire way to dig yourself into a hole financially. Develop a budget and stick to it; this will help you stay disciplined with your spending and keep your finances on track.

3) Don't believe everything you hear.

When it comes to money, there are plenty of myths and misconceptions swirling around out there. So before you make any financial decisions, do your research and make sure you have all the facts. Otherwise, you could end up making a costly mistake.

4) Invest wisely.

Investing can be a great way to grow your money over time, but it's important to invest wisely. Do your homework before investing in any kind of security or fund, and consult with an experienced financial advisor if needed. This will help ensure that your investments are working hard for you – and not the other way around.
