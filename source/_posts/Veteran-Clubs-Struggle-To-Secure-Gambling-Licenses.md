#  Veteran Clubs Struggle To Secure Gambling Licenses

It’s been more than a year since the US Supreme Court decision paved the way for states to legalize sports betting. Yet, as we head into the NFL season, there are still only a handful of states with operational sportsbooks.

This is largely due to the fact that many states are requiring casinos and other gambling venues to partner with existing sports leagues in order to secure a gambling license. This has proven to be difficult for many veteran clubs, who have been locked out of the market by niche or regional sports leagues.

In Pennsylvania, for example, the Philadelphia 76ers were forced to partner with the state’s minor league hockey team, the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, in order to secure a license. Similarly, in New Jersey, the New York Yankees were forced to partner with the minor league baseball club Hudson Valley Renegades.

Many other veteran clubs have been shut out of the market altogether. The Detroit Tigers, for example, were passed over by three different casinos before finally striking a partnership with MotorCity Casino. The Miami Dolphins were rebuffed by all four major casino companies in Florida before striking a deal with Hard Rock Casino.

League officials say that these partnerships are essential in order to prevent corruption and game-fixing. But many operators and observers feel that these leagues are simply trying to protect their monopolies.

“There’s no question that these deals are done primarily for financial gain,” said one casino executive who asked not to be named. “The leagues want a piece of the action and they’re not going to let anyone else in without paying up.”

The NFL Players Association has voiced its support for these partnerships, but many players have expressed concerns about being too closely associated with gambling establishments.

“Personally I don’t like it, but I understand why the league is doing it,” said Packers tight end Jimmy Graham. “They see this as an opportunity to make money and they want to make sure that they get their share. But as players we just need to be careful and make sure that we don’t get too close to these casinos. They can be pretty dangerous places.”

#  Veterans Clubs Fear Losing Business Without Gambling

Veterans clubs around the state are concerned about the future of their businesses without gambling. The legalization of gambling has been a major source of revenue for these clubs, and many are worried about how they will make up the difference.

"This is a huge hit to our business," said one club manager. "We're not sure how we're going to make it up."

Clubs have already seen a decrease in business since the legalization of gambling, and they expect this trend to continue. Without gambling, they fear that they will soon be out of business.

"Our members rely on us for entertainment," said another club manager. "If we can't provide that, they'll go somewhere else."

Club managers are currently exploring other ways to bring in revenue, but so far, there are no guarantees. They hope that the state will find a way to help them keep their businesses afloat.

#  Political Pressure Mounts On Veteran Clubs To Allow Gambling

Veteran clubs are coming under increasing pressure to allow gambling on their premises, as the number of licensed venues continues to decline.

The state government has already flagged its intention to issue new licences for more poker machines, and is believed to be keen to see veteran clubs participate in the sector.

This follows a trend that has seen the number of gaming machines in Victoria decline by almost 9,000 in the past six years. The total number now stands at just over 66,000, down from 75,000 in 2012.

A spokesperson for the government said it was determined to ensure that Victorians had access to safe and responsible gambling services.

“We know that some veterans’ clubs provide important social functions for their members and their families, and we want to ensure these clubs can continue offering those services while also providing opportunities for gambling,” she said.

But veteran clubs said they were not interested in becoming gaming venues and did not want their members subjected to the potential harms associated with gambling.

“Our club is about providing a social space for our members and their families, not about encouraging them to lose money on poker machines,” one spokesperson said.

#  Veteran Clubs Could Lose Millions If Gambling Ban Remains

The Australian Football League (AFL) Association has voiced its concerns over potential revenue losses should the federal government decide to ban gambling advertising at sporting events.

AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said that if the proposed gambling advertising ban goes ahead, it would have a significant impact on veteran clubs such as Carlton and Collingwood, who are heavily reliant on gambling sponsorship deals.

“Clubs like Carlton and Collingwood, which have a lot of gaming sponsors, will lose millions and millions of dollars in revenue,” McLachlan said.

The proposed ban was announced by Communications Minister Mitch Fifield in January and is currently being reviewed by a parliamentary committee. The ban would prohibit all forms of gambling advertising during live sporting events, including television broadcasts, stadiums and online platforms.

McLachlan said that the AFL fully supports efforts to protect consumers from the risks associated with problem gambling, but added that the proposed ban is disproportionate and could lead to job losses across the sports broadcasting industry.

“We believe there’s a better way to do this than just blanket banning all advertising during sport, because it will impact jobs … and also the ability for fans to see product and understand what their team is doing,” he said.

The AFL has estimated that clubs could lose up to $200 million in revenue if the proposed ban goes ahead. Gambling companies are understood to be among the league’s biggest sponsors, with betting giant Tabcorp paying more than $70 million over six years to be its official partner.

#  Veteran Clubs Call On The Government To Support Their Gambling Rights

Veteran clubs across the UK have called on the government to support their gambling rights, as they feel they are being unfairly targeted by current legislation.

Clubs such as the Royal British Legion and the Chelsea Pensioners have for many years offered members the chance to bet on horse racing, with profits often used to support the running of the club. However, under new legislation introduced in 2014, these bets are now considered illegal.

The clubs argue that they should be exempt from this legislation, as they are not commercial organisations and their members are not making any profit from betting. They also claim that the government is aware of their activities and has failed to take action against them in the past.

A spokesperson for the Chelsea Pensioners said: "We've been operating in a perfectly legal way for many years, and now find ourselves having to fight for our rights. The government is targeting us because we're an easy target, but we're not going to take this lying down."

The clubs say they will continue to fight for their rights and are hopeful that the government will eventually see sense and grant them an exemption from the legislation.
