The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by taking tricks and scoring points for the cards held in your hand. The player who scores the most points at the end of the game wins!</p>
<p>To begin, all players must agree on a trump suit. The trump suit is a special suit that outranks all other suits in the game. If there is no agreement, then the card game cannot be played. After a trump suit has been determined, each player is dealt 7 cards, face down. The remaining cards are placed in the middle of the players (face down), forming the stock pile. The player who was dealt the highest card in the trump suit becomes the first dealer and play passes clockwise around the table.<br>The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by taking tricks and scoring points for the cards held in your hand. The player who scores the most points at the end of the game wins!</p>
<p>To take a trick, simply place one of your cards face up on top of the stock pile and then draw another card from the stock pile to replace it. The next player then does likewise until all players have either taken or declined to take a trick; thereby ending that particular round of play. At this point, whoever placed the highest card in their chosen trump suit - ie., winning trick - takes both cards from atop of the stock pile and sets them aside, face up in front of themself (scoring 1 point for each). These two cards count towards their final score at the end of the game - regardless as to whether they were part of any winning tricks or not (ie., even if they picked up all 7 winning tricks, they would still only score 2 points instead of 14). The winner of each individual trick then leads next with any card they like from their hand - excluding any Spades that have already been played!<br>The aim now is to keep picking up tricks until you either can’t or don’t want to play anymore cards from your hand. This concludes that particular round of play and again, whomever placed highest (in this case Ace) in their chosen trump suit takes both cards from atop of stock pile and sets them face-up in front-of-themselves as before (scoring 1 point for each), etc… Play then continues until one player either runs out of cards or else decides to ‘stop’ playing i.e., discards remaining hand onto wastepaper basket (or some other agreed designated area) face down thereby ending their turn without playing any further card(s). At this juncture, every other active player still has an opportunity to ‘rob’ them blind by playing one final Spade (this MUST be done when it’s your turn; you cannot hold onto it waiting for somebody else to do it for you!). If successful, opponent captures all previously discarded cards thus turning your disadvantage into an outright victory; otherwise…<br>When it comes time tally up scores at endgame, first deduct however many points you lost during play - due mainly to Spades opponents captured during endgame robbery attempt(s) as well assome other minor deductions such as revoke(s), revoked penalty etc.. Add together totals scored from taking winning tricks plus those extra points gained by having particular high-ranking Hearts &amp; Diamonds still left in your hand at endgame culmination (see below). Highest scorer wins!</p>
<p>   How To Play </p>
<p>  There are usually four players in an 888 Card Game but there can be more or less depending on how many people are playing .After everyone has decided on a Trump Suit ,deal 7 Cards each person .Then put Face Down all but 4 Cards .These 4 becomethe Stock Pile .The Ace through 9of Clubs become trumps.(In case there is no Club Suit ,the A through 9of any other Suit will do.)<br>The person who gets first go starts by leading any Card EXCEPT A Spade  .Everyone else must follow Suit if able .If unableTo Follow Suit ,play any other Card except Spade .The highestCard played becomesSuit Exception and if thatisAce ,then King becomeSuit Exception .Winnerof Trick gets bothCards puttowards theirScore .If led withSpade ,opponentcaptures entire Trick includingSpades .Carry onuntilsomeoneruns outcards endingthatRound .Then restart by leadingwithanycardexceptSpade followedby same Rules etc….</p>
<p> Points worth mentioning :<br>-Highest Trump Card is #11(QueenofClubs) instead usual#10(KingofClubs) ; thus making it easier toget4th trick if opponent doesntfollow spades (normallywould need 5th spade ) </p>

This exciting game can be enjoyed by players of all ages and skill levels. The objective of the game is to score points by taking as many tricks as possible. The player who takes the most amount of tricks at the end of the game wins!</p>
<p>888 is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The game is best suited for four players, but can also be played with two or three players. The dealer deals seven cards to each player, face down. The remaining cards are placed in the middle of the table, face down, to form a stockpile. The top card of the stockpile is turned over to begin the turn.</p>
<p>The player to the left of the dealer begins the game by playing any card from their hand. The next player then plays a card, either matching the rank or suit of the first card played, or playing a different card. If they cannot play a card, they must draw one from the deck and miss their turn. When both players have exhausted their hands, the player who played the highest ranking card takes both cards and leads off into another round. If two or more players played cards of equal rank, then whoever played the highest ranked suit takes both cards.</p>
<p>The aim of 888 is to take as many tricks as possible. A trick is won when all players have played a card and the highest rank (or suit) wins. The player who wins the most tricks at the end of the game is declared the winner!</p>

<h1 id="How-do-I-win-in-888-Card-Game"><a href="#How-do-I-win-in-888-Card-Game" class="headerlink" title="How do I win in 888 Card Game?"></a>How do I win in 888 Card Game?</h1><p>888 Card Game is a classic two-player card game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. The game is won by the player who first accumulates 100 points or more. Points are scored by taking cards from the stock and laying them out on the table in specific combinations. In this guide, we will teach you how to win at 888 Card Game.</p>
<p>The first step to winning 888 Card Game is understanding the basic rules of the game. The game is played with a deck of 52 cards, which are divided equally between two players. A player starts the game by drawing four cards from the deck and then discarding one. Play passes to the left, and each player takes turn drawing one card and discarding one. The aim of the game is to take all of the cards from the opponent’s hand.</p>
<p>There are several different combinations that can be formed using the cards in your hand. The most common combination is three of a kind, also known as a “triplet”. This can be formed by either taking three cards of the same rank from the deck or by taking two cards of one rank and one card of another rank from the opponent’s hand. Other combinations include pairs (two of a kind), runs (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit), flushes (five or more cards of the same suit) and straights (five or more consecutive cards not all of the same suit).</p>
<p>In order to win 888 Card Game, you need to be able to recognise these combinations and put them together into plays that will reduce your opponent’s hand size. Most importantly, you need to remember that you cannot lay down any combination that has already been used up – even if it is in your opponent’s hand!</p>
<p>Here are some basic tips for winning 888 Card Game:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Keep track of what has been played – This is probably the most important skill for winning 888 Card Game. It is crucial that you keep track of what has been played so far, as well as what is still in your opponent’s hand. This way, you will know which combinations are available to play and which ones have already been used up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Put pressure on your opponent – Try to force your opponent into making mistakes by putting pressure on them with strategic plays. If they don’t have enough cards to form any playable combination, they will have to discard their remaining cards which gives you an advantage.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware of jokers – Jokers can be very helpful when trying to form certain combinations. However, they can also be very dangerous as they can potentially change the rank of any other card in play. Make sure you use jokers wisely!</p>
